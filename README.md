**DESCRIPTION:**

The Python3 script found under this repository, itends to provide pentesters, CTF players, and others a __template__ to test vulnerable parameters or undiscovered directories.

The main advantatge of using this scirpt, is that it is __easily customable__ for mostly-all situations. Since this is script is pretty short, you know exactly what the script will do, so you don't send unintended requests by accident or similar.

Both, experts and beginners may benefit from using this script. One's for performing fast and efficient tests, and the others to skip the phase of writing your own exploits from scratch.
